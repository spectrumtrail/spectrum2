          %li Compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.
        %p We will not use your personal information for purposes other than those purposes we have disclosed to you, without your permission. From time to time we may request your permission to allow us to share your personal information with third parties. You may opt out of having your personal information shared with third parties, or from allowing us to use your personal information for any purpose that is incompatible with the purposes for which we originally collected it or subsequently obtained your authorization. If you choose to so limit the use of your personal information, certain features or My App Services may not be available to you.
        %h3 Marketing
        %p We will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize My App Services, content and advertising.
        %h3 How we share personal information with other parties
        %p We may share your personal information with:
        %ul
          %li Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing and technology services.

          %li Financial institutions with which we partner.
          %li Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. You will receive prior notice of any change in applicable policy.)
          %li
            Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when:
            %ul
              %li We are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure; or
              %li We believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.
          %li Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.
        %p My App will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes and only shares your personal information with third parties as described in this policy. Before My App shares your information with any third party that is not acting as an agent to perform tasks on behalf of and under the instructions of My App, My App will first ensure that the third party either subscribes to the Principles, or is subject to the European Union"s Directive on Data Protection, or enters into a written agreement with My App requiring that the third party will provide at least the same level of privacy protection as required by the Principles.
        %p If you establish a My App account indirectly on a third party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on a My App website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application and your information may be subject to their privacy policies.
        %p In general, we will notify you of material changes to this policy by updating the last updated date at the top of this page, and we will provide you with explicit notice of material changes as required by law. We recommend that you visit this page frequently to check for changes.
        %h3 How you can access or change your personal information
        %p You are entitled to review, correct, or amend your personal information, or to delete that information where it is inaccurate, and you may do so at any time by logging in to your account and clicking the Profile or Account tab. This right shall only be limited where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated. If you close your My App account, we will mark your account in our database as "Closed," but will keep your account information in our database for a period of time described above. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if you close your account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law, or in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
